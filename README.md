I got all of the batting data from baseball-reference dot com. 
Path for data: Seasons>All Seasons>League>Batting> then the years (from the middle of the page). On the webpage itself you can then edit out the columns you don't want and export it as a csv. I did that for both Leages, years 1998-2008, or, what's been called "The Steroid Era." I then cleaned up 14K rows of data and combined AL & NL years, saved as a csv file.

Following the years of changes to the evolving MLB drug policy (listed below before the statistical testing portion), I want to compare decades, specifically the “steroid era” or, 1998-2008, (in 1998, McGwire admitted to using a (then legal) drug that was related to steroids) to see if there is a statistically significant difference in the years for both leagues as well as the numbers for players in that time period. Other questions I have: Is one League more dominant than the other? How do those who tested positive &/or were suspended with PED use compare to the rest of the players? My null hypothesis is that drug use had no effect on the HR numbers over the various decades. Let's see what I find! I decided to focus on HR numbers because OBP (on base %), SLG (Slugging %) & OPS (on-base + SLG) were already averages.
